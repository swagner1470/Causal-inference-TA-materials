# Causal Inference TA Recitations - PLSC 7553 SP 21
*IN PROGRESS*

This repository is intended as a place for storage and sharing of the recitation files I used while a TA for a causal inference course in Spring 2021. These files are build upon the work shared by Jon Green (https://jgreen4919.github.io/) and Brian Finch (https://polisci.osu.edu/people/finch.140) and likely all previous colleagues who held this particular position at OSU. I am merely providing a place to share the files I used for future TAs and anyone who may benefit from them.
